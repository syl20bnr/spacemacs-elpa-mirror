This package provides the `cycle-quotes' command to cycle between
different string quote styles. For instance, in JavaScript, there's
three string quote characters: ", ` and '.  In a JavaScript buffer,
with point located someplace within the string, `cycle-quotes' will
cycle between the following quote styles each time it's called:

   --> "Hi, it's me!" --> `Hi, it's me!` --> 'Hi, it\'s me!' --
  |                                                            |
   ------------------------------------------------------------

As seen in the above example, `cycle-quotes' tries to escape and
unescape quote characters intelligently.
