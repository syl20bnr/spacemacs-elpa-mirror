Highlights code by scope.  Top-level scopes are one color, second-level
scopes are another color, and so on.  Variables retain the color of the scope
in which they are defined.  A variable defined in an outer scope referenced
by an inner scope is colored the same as the outer scope.

By default, comments and strings are still highlighted syntactically.
