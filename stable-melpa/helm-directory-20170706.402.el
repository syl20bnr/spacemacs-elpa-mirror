;;; Commentary:

;; You can select directory before select the file with helm interface.
;; Since the directory has important meanings at the framework,
;; I want to complement with helm only the files that is in the meaningful directory.
;; This package provide it.
;; When you select a directory with helm, the file in that directory can be used with helm.
