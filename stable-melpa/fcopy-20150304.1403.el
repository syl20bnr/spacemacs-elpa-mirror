;;; Commentary:

;; Funny Copy (Fcopy) is a minor mode to copy text; first, set the
;; paste point, and next look for the text to copy.  The past point is
;; the point where fcopy-mode start.  One stroke commands are prepared
;; to search and copy the text.  Copy commands automatically take the
;; cursor back to the past point, insert the text, and exit
;; fcopy-mode.

;; `q' and `C-g' is for exit fcopy-mode.  `?' for more help.

;; If you want to move (cut) text, not to copy, type `C-d' to toggle
;; on delete flag.  If the buffer is originally read only, deleting
;; and copying will fail.

;; If some scratches are in your copy text, you can modify it before
;; paste.  Before the copy command, type `m' to toggle on modify flag.
;; It prepares modify buffer, that you can modify the text with
;; replacement or overwrite.  See `fmodify-default-mode' or `C-h m' in
;; the modify buffer.  To insert modified text, type `C-cC-c'.
;; `C-cC-q' for quit modifying, and paste nothing.

;; The latest fcopy.el is available at:
;;
;;   https://github.com/ataka/fcopy
;;

;; The other simple copy command is distributed with Emacs.  See
;; misc.el in your lisp directory.  It copies characters from previous
;; non-blank line, starting just above point.  But remember, fcopy has
;; no influences from misc.el.

;;; How to install:

;; To install, put this in your .emacs file:
;;
;;  (autoload 'fcopy "fcopy" "Copy lines or region without editing." t)
;;
;; And bind it to any key you like:
;;
;;  (define-key mode-specific-map "k" 'fcopy)  ; C-c k for fcopy
;;

;;; Version and ChangeLog:

(defconst fcopy-version "7.0"
  "Version numbers of this version of Funny Copy.")

;; ver 7.0  2015/02/19
;; * New command fcopy; Do not call fcopy-mode directly.
;; * Drop fmodify-mode, see sugaryank.
;; * Available in melpa.

;; ver 6.0
;; * Hosted at github.
;; * Support utf-8 (unsupport EUC-JP).

;; ver 5.2.6  (Rev. 2.43)
;; * fcopy skips black lines in line moving commands.
;;   If mark is active, they does not skip blank lines.
;; * New function fmodify-query-replace-regexp is binded to [M-RET].
;; * Fixed problem for negative and zero argument in line moving commands.
;; * Fixed bug of misscounting paren when copying text between parens.

;; ver 5.2.5  (Rev. 2.35)  2003/07/09 01:45:26
;; * fcopy now go back to the correct paste point when deleting before
;;   fcopy-point.

;; ver 5.2.4  (Rev. 2.32)  2003/06/16 10:45:47
;; * Fix for XEmacs.
;; * Find proper paren pair even the point is in the multiple parens.

;; ver 5.2.3  (Rev. 2.26)  2002/12/02 14:20:41
;; * Support move mode; delete text and copy it.
;; * [rutern] is to replace command, in fmodify edit mode.

;; ver 5.2.2  (Rev. 2.20)  2002/11/17 21:56:09

;;   when strings contains Japanese character.

;; ver 5.2.1  (Rev. 2.16)  2002/11/12 01:27:27
;; * Change function of [space] to scroll-up.
;;   Use `.' to set mark.
;; * Change URL of Funny Copy support page.
;; * `(' now copy text between paired-strings like (...).
;;   `)' likewise, but does not copy the paired-strings.
;; * `;' copy comment text depending on major mode.

;; ver 5.2  2002/11/10 10:40:59  Masayuki Ataka
;; Minor version up of Funny Copy.  Merge fmodify.el.
;; Usage is in commentary section.

;; ver 5.1  2002/10/13 06:24:19  Masayuki Ataka
;; Minor version up of Funny Copy.  Use minor mode instead of major
;; mode.

;; ver 5.0  2002/09/06 05:54:06  Masayuki Ataka
;; The Fifth version of Funny Copy.  Remove tedious codes, like
;; `funny-copy-show-kill-ring', support of custom package, and a lot
;; of user options.  Make it sure to work with Emacs 19.

;; ver 4.0  2000/02/22 22:41:02  Masayuki Ataka
;; The Fourth version of Funny Copy.  Support Funny Modify mode.
;; New function name was `funny-copy-mode', binded to `C-c k'

;; ver 3.0  1999/04/24 00:17:33  Masayuki Ataka
;; Third version of Funny Copy.  Rewrite code from full scratch,
;; implemented with major mode.  New function name was
;; `MA-Special-copy-mode', means Masayuki Ataka special copy mode.
;; Also support seeing the inside of kill-ring.

;; ver 2.0  1998/09/??  Masayuki Ataka
;; Second version of Funny Copy.  Code name was `lupin'.  Copy text
;; interactively using cond.

;; ver 1.0  1998/08/??  Masayuki Ataka
