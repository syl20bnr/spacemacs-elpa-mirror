;; style of your C/C++ code on the fly.

;;;; Setup

;; (eval-after-load 'flycheck
;;   '(progn
;;      (require 'flycheck-cstyle)
;;      (flycheck-cstyle-setup)
;;      ;; chain after cppcheck since this is the last checker in the upstream
;;      ;; configuration
;;      (flycheck-add-next-checker 'c/c++-cppcheck '(warning . cstyle))))

;; If you do not use cppcheck then chain after clang / gcc / other C checker
;; that you use

;; (flycheck-add-next-checker 'c/c++-clang '(warning . cstyle))

;;; Code:
(require 'flycheck)

(flycheck-def-config-file-var flycheck-cstyle-config cstyle
                              ".cstyle"
  :safe #'stringp)

(flycheck-define-checker cstyle
  "A checker using cstyle.
