Suppose that you have switched to Dvorak or Colemak.  Chances are you're
going to use that layout everywhere, not only in Emacs (the fact is, we
still need to leave Emacs sometimes and use other programs), so you setup
it on OS level or maybe you even have “hardware” Dvorak keyboard.  You
adapt to this new layout and everything is OK.

Now suppose that you need to input non-Latin text and for that you
naturally need to activate an input method in Emacs.  The nightmare
begins: input methods in Emacs translate Latin characters as if they are
on a traditional QWERTY layout.  So now the input method you used before
does not work anymore.

One solution is to define new custom input method and call it for example
`dvorak-russian'.  But that is not a general solution for the problem —
we want to be able to make any existing input method work just the same
with any Latin layout on OS level.  This package generates “fixed” input
methods knowing input method that corresponds to layout on OS level and
input method you want to fix.  And I want to tell you — it's a win.
