;;; Commentary:

;;; This module makes CUA mode's S-up/S-down selection movement work
;;; in minibuffer.

;;; Code:

(defun minibuffer-cua-forward-line (&optional n)
  "Call `forward-line' with argument N, preventing the cursor from moving into the prompt string."
  (forward-line n)
  (when (= (point-min) (point))
    (end-of-line)
    (beginning-of-line)))

(defun minibuffer-cua-shift-next-line (&optional n)
  "Emulate [S-down] selection of CUA mode, moving N lines forward."
  (interactive "p")
  (or mark-active
      (push-mark (point) t t))
  (minibuffer-cua-forward-line n))

(defun minibuffer-cua-shift-previous-line (&optional n)
  "Emulate [S-up] selection of CUA mode, moving N lines backward."
  (interactive "p")
  (or mark-active
      (push-mark (point) t t))
  (minibuffer-cua-forward-line (- n)))
