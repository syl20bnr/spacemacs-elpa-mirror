;;
;; Remember the last used theme between Emacs sessions. When you quit
;; Emacs, the current theme settings will be stored as if they had
;; been set using `customize-themes'.
;;
;; Usage:
;;  (require 'remember-last-theme) ; if installed manually
;;  (remember-last-theme-enable)
;;
;;; Code:
(require 'cus-edit)

(defun remember-last-theme-save ()
  "Save the current theme(s) for next sessions."
  (interactive)
  (customize-save-variable 'custom-enabled-themes custom-enabled-themes))

(defun remember-last-theme-with-file-save (filename)
  "Save the current theme(s) for next sessions."
  (defun perform-save ()
    (interactive)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (print custom-enabled-themes (current-buffer))
      (if (file-writable-p filename)
          (write-file filename)
        (message (format "Cannot save themes because %s is not writable" filename))))))

(defun remember-last-theme-with-file-load (filename)
  "Load the current theme(s) for current session."
  (defun perform-load ()
    (interactive)
    (if (file-readable-p filename)
        (mapc
         'load-theme
         (read (with-temp-buffer
                 (insert-file-contents filename)
                 (buffer-string))))
      (message (format "Cannot load saved themes because %s is not readable" filename)))))

;;;###autoload
(defun remember-last-theme-enable ()
  "Ensure that the current theme(s) will be saved when Emacs exits."
  (interactive)
  (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'remember-last-theme-save))
