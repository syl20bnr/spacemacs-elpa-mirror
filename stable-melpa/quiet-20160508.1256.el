;;; Commentary:

;; A simple package to disconnect from the online world for a while,
;; possibly reconnecting later. Any interruptions or distractions
;; which occur once the command is run are guaranteed to be local.
;;
;; 'M-x quiet' will disconnect from the network, optionally
;; reconnecting after a certain time.
;;
;; the function 'quiet' can be used anywhere in emacs where a lack of
;; network access could be seen as a feature, e.g. as a mode-hook (or
;; with defadvice) to your preferred distraction free writing
;; environment.
;;
;; you may need to customize or setq quiet-disconnect and
;; quiet-connect to the appropriate shell commands to turn your
;; network (interface) on or off
;;
;;; Code:


(defcustom  quiet-disconnect "networksetup -setairportpower airport off"
  "Shell command to turn off network connection(s)"
  :type 'string
  :options '("networksetup -setairportpower airport off" "ifdown wlan0")
  :group 'quiet)

(defcustom  quiet-connect "networksetup -setairportpower airport on"
  "Shell command to turn on network connection(s)"
  :type 'string
  :options '("networksetup -setairportpower airport off" "ifup wlan0")
  :group 'quiet)

(defcustom  quiet-timer 0
  "Timer to reconnect network after a given time (in minutes). A value of 0 will leave the connection off"
  :type 'integer
  :group 'quiet)

;;;###autoload
(defun quiet ()
  "quieten network distractions for a while..."
  (interactive)
  (save-window-excursion
    (message "disconnecting...")
    (async-shell-command quiet-disconnect))
  (if (not (= quiet-timer 0))
      (progn 
	(run-at-time (* quiet-timer 60) nil 'quiet-reconnect))))

;;;###autoload
(defun quiet-reconnect ()
  (interactive)
  (save-window-excursion
    (message "reconnecting after ~%d %s" quiet-timer (if (= quiet-timer 1) "minute" "minutes"))
    (async-shell-command quiet-connect)))

(provide 'quiet)
