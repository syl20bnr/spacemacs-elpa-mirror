;;; Commentary:

;; python-x extends the built-in `python-mode' (F. Gallina's) with several
;; additional functions and behaviors inspired by `ess-mode' which are targeted
;; to interactive code evaluation with an inferior Python process.
;;
;; python-x allows to evaluate code blocks using comments as delimiters (code
;; "sections") or using arbitrarily nested folding marks. By default, a code
;; section is delimited by comments starting with "# ---"; while folds are
;; defined by "# {{{" and "# }}}" (see `python-shell-send-fold-or-section').
;;
;; python-x installs an handler to show uncaught exceptions produced by
;; interactive code evaluation by default. See `python-shell-show-exceptions'
;; to control this behavior.
;;
;; The following functions are introduced:
;; - `python-shell-send-line': evaluate and print the current line, accounting
;;   for statement and line continuations.
;; - `python-shell-send-line-and-step': evaluate and current line as above,
;;   then move the point to the next automatically.
;; - `python-shell-send-paragraph': evaluate the current paragraph.
;; - `python-shell-send-paragraph-and-step': evaluate the current paragraph,
;;   then move the point to the next automatically.
;; - `python-shell-send-region-or-paragraph': evaluate the current region when
;;   active, otherwise evaluate the current paragraph.
;; - `python-shell-send-fold-or-section': evaluate the region defined by the
;;   current code fold or section.
;; - `python-shell-send-dwim': evaluate the region when active,
;;   otherwise revert to the current fold or section.
;; - `python-shell-print-region-or-symbol': evaluate and print the current
;;   region or symbol at point, displaying the inferior process output.
;;
;; python-x uses `volatile-highlights', when available, for highlighting
;; multi-line blocks. Installation through "melpa" is recommended (you don't
;; actually need to enable `volatile-highlights-mode' itself). python-x also
;; uses `folding' to interpret and define folding marks. `folding-mode' needs
;; to be enabled manually if code folding is also desired.
;;
;; Read through the Usage section in the source file for usage instructions and
;; recommended keybindings.

;;; Usage:

;; Add the following to your .emacs to load 'python-x on-demand:
;;
;; (eval-after-load 'python
;;   (lambda ()
;;     (require 'python-x)
;;     ;; Suggested keybindings (ESS-like)
;;     (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-j") 'python-shell-send-line)
;;     (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-n") 'python-shell-send-line-and-step)
;;     (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-f") 'python-shell-send-defun)
;;     (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-b") 'python-shell-send-buffer)
;;     (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'python-shell-send-dwim)
;;     (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'python-shell-print-region-or-symbol)))
