This package work `ac-html' and `company-web', please, install one of these.

Preinstall:

Install `csswatcher':

  sudo cpan i CSS::Watcher

Note:

Please, keep CSS::Watcher up-to-date.
Recommended version of csswatcher is 0.4.0 (run `csswatcher -v'). Update:

  sudo cpan i CSS::Watcher

Configuration, Emacs:

  (require 'ac-html-csswatcher)
  (ac-html-csswatcher-setup)
  ;; or if you prefer company-style names:
  (company-web-csswatcher-setup)

To enable completion when editing html use M-x `ac-html-csswatcher+' (or `company-web-csswatcher+') or add it in your hook.

Configuration, project:

File ".csswatcher" may indicate root of your project and used for set ignored files:

  % cat .csswatcher
  # ignore all css
  ignore: \.css$
  # except app.css
  use: app\.css

Otherwise projectile way used for root directory.

So if you use `ac-html-bootstrap' and don't want to parse your bootstrap.css
create in your project file .csswatcher with line:

  ignore: bootstrap

Note: completion  will regenerated by csswatcher  after saving css,
less,   opening   html(jade,slim,haml)   files,  or   manually   by
`ac-html-csswatcher-refresh' or `company-web-csswatcher-refresh'.
