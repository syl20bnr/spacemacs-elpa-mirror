This is an emacs-based interface to the notmuch mail system.

You will first need to have the notmuch program installed and have a
notmuch database built in order to use this. See
https://notmuchmail.org for details.

To install this software, copy it to a directory that is on the
`load-path' variable within emacs (a good candidate is
/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp). If you are viewing this from the
notmuch source distribution then you can simply run:

	sudo make install-emacs

to install it.

Then, to actually run it, add:

	(autoload 'notmuch "notmuch" "Notmuch mail" t)

to your ~/.emacs file, and then run "M-x notmuch" from within emacs,
or run:

	emacs -f notmuch

Have fun, and let us know if you have any comment, questions, or
kudos: Notmuch list <notmuch@notmuchmail.org> (subscription is not
required, but is available from https://notmuchmail.org).
