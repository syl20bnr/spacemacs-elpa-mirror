el-exiftool is an elisp wrapper around ExifTool.  ExifTool supports
reading and writing metadata in various formats including EXIF, XMP
and IPTC.

There is a significant overhead in loading ExifTool for every
command to be exected. So, el-exiftool starts an ExifTool process
in the -stay_open mode, and passes all commands to it. For more
about ExifTool's -stay_open mode, see
