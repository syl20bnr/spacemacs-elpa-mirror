These five color themes are designed for use with Emacs' built-in
theme support in Emacs 24. However, they also work with older Emacs
versions, in which case color-theme.el is required.

Usage:

If your Emacs has the `load-theme' command, you can use it to
activate one of these themes programatically, or use
`customize-themes' to select a theme interactively.

Alternatively, or in older Emacs versions, use one of the provided
wrapper commands to activate a theme:

    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-day
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-night
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-blue
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-bright
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties
