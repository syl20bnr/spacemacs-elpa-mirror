This library links a set of shell commands to file or directory
names. These commands can then be used in dired mode using
`dired-do-shell-command' (or pressing "!"). Since this library
modifies the behavior of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user', the
command syntax will follow that variable's syntax (see the
documentation of `dired-do-shell-command' for more).
