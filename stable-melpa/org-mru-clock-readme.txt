Do you often clock in to many different little tasks? Are you
annoyed that you can't just clock in to one of your most recent
tasks after restarting Emacs? This package replaces functions like
`org-clock-select-task' and `org-clock-in-last' with functions
`org-mru-clock-select-recent-task' and `org-mru-clock-in', which
first ensure that `org-clock-history' is filled with your
`org-mru-clock-how-many' most recent tasks, and let you pick from
a list before clocking in.

It also uses `completing-read-function' (overridable with
`org-mru-clock-completing-read') on `org-mru-clock-in' to make
clocking in even faster.

To use, require and bind whatever keys you prefer to the
interactive functions:

(require 'org-mru-clocks)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-x i") #'org-mru-clock-in)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-x C-j") #'org-mru-clock-select-recent-task)

Maybe trade some initial slowness for more tasks cached:

(setq org-mru-clock-how-many 100)

But don't set it higher than the actual number of tasks; then
it'll always try (and fail) to fill up the history cache!

If you want to use ivy for `org-mru-clock-in':

(setq org-mru-clock-completing-read #'ivy-completing-read)


If you prefer `use-package', the above settings would be:

(use-package org-mru-clock
  :ensure t
  :bind* (("C-c C-x i" . org-mru-clock-in)
          ("C-c C-x C-j" . org-mru-clock-select-recent-task))
  :init
  (setq org-mru-clock-how-many 100
        org-mru-clock-completing-read #'ivy-completing-read))
