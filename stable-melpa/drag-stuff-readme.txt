drag-stuff is a minor mode for dragging stuff around in Emacs. You
can drag lines, words and region.

To use drag-stuff, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/directory/or/file")

Then require drag-stuff
(require 'drag-stuff)

To start drag-stuff
(drag-stuff-mode t) or M-x drag-stuff-mode

drag-stuff is buffer local, so hook it up
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'drag-stuff-mode)

Or use the global mode to activate it in all buffers.
(drag-stuff-global-mode t)

Drag Stuff stores a list (`drag-stuff-except-modes') of modes in
which `drag-stuff-mode' should not be activated in (note, only if
you use the global mode) because of conflicting use.

You can add new except modes:
  (add-to-list 'drag-stuff-except-modes 'conflicting-mode)

Default modifier key is the meta-key. This can be changed and is
controlled by the variable `drag-stuff-modifier'.

Control key as modifier:
  (setq drag-stuff-modifier 'control)

Meta and Shift keys as modifier:
  (setq drag-stuff-modifier '(meta shift))
