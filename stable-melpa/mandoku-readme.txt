"Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the
same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger
and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish."
-Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command Line"

This package brings the power of Emacs to people working with
premodern Chinese texts by extending org-mode and providing
routines for helping with reading, annotating and translating of
such texts.  For more information see http://www.mandoku.org
