This program is derived from comint-mode and provides the following features.

 * TAB completion same as Babel.js REPL
 * file name completion in string
 * incremental history search


Put this file in your Emacs lisp path (e.g. ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp)
and add the following line to your .emacs:

   (require 'babel-repl)

Type M-x babel-repl to run Babel.js REPL.
See also `comint-mode' to check key bindings.
