Quickstart

    (require 'buffer-utils)

    (buffer-utils-save-order
      (bury-buffer "*scratch*"))

    ;; buffer order is now restored

Explanation

Buffer-utils.el is a collection of functions for buffer manipulation.

This library exposes very little user-level interface; it is
generally useful only for programming in Emacs Lisp.

To use buffer-utils, place the buffer-utils.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'buffer-utils)

The following functions and macros are provided:

    `buffer-utils-all-in-mode'
    `buffer-utils-all-matching'
    `buffer-utils-bury-and-forget'   ; can be called interactively
    `buffer-utils-first-matching'
    `buffer-utils-huge-p'
    `buffer-utils-in-mode'
    `buffer-utils-most-recent-file-associated'
    `buffer-utils-narrowed-p'
    `buffer-utils-save-order'
    `buffer-utils-set-order'

of which `buffer-utils-save-order' is the most notable.

`buffer-utils-save-order' is a macro, similar to `save-current-buffer',
which saves and restores the order of the buffer list.
