`Vhdl-tools' provide a derived major mode based on the great `vhdl-mode'.
It adds an extra layer of functionality on top of the later, extensively
using `ggtags' to manage a vhdl project.  `Vhdl-tools' relies on `projectile',
`imenu' and `outshine' features to ease navigating vhdl
sources.  Additionally, it provides `vOrg' mode too, which benefits of all
`Org' features.
