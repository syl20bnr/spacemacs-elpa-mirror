;;; Commentary:

;; Issue M-x git-wip-timemachine to start browsing through WIP
;; versions of a file.
;;
;; Control the time machine using the following keys:
;;
;; . -- Visit current WIP version.
;; > -- Visit current WIP version.
;; < -- Visit oldest WIP version
;;      (equivalent to merge base of current branch and associated WIP branch
;;      *if* merge base introduces changes to current file).
;; p -- Visit previous WIP version.
;; n -- Visit next WIP version.
;; w -- Copy the abbreviated hash of the current WIP version.
;; W -- Copy the full hash of the current WIP version.
;; q -- Exit the time machine.
;;
;; Finally, there's also `git-wip-timemachine-toggle` which does exactly
;; what its name suggests: If the timemachine is on, calling this command
;; will turn it off (and vice versa).

;;; Installation

;; 1. If you haven't already, set up `git-wip`:
;;
;;    - Clone the "git-wip" package to your $HOME directory:
;;
;;      $ cd
;;      $ git clone https://github.com/itsjeyd/git-wip
;;
;;      If you decide to clone to a different directory and that
;;      directory is *not* part of your `exec-path' in Emacs, you'll
;;      need to add the following code to your init-file (to make sure
;;      Emacs can find the git-wip script):
;;
;;      (add-to-list 'exec-path "/path/to/git-wip")
;;
;;    - Add the following code to your init-file:
;;
;;      (load "/path/to/git-wip/emacs/git-wip.el")
;;
;;      From now on, every time you save a file that is part of a git
;;      repository, Emacs will automatically create a WIP commit by
;;      calling out to git-wip for you.
;;
;; 2. Install `git-wip-timemachine' from MELPA via:
;;
;;    M-x package-install RET git-wip-timemachine RET

;;; Credits:

;; git-wip-timemachine is a modified version of git-timemachine
;; (https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine) by Peter Stiernström, so
;; all credit for the original idea goes to him.
