;; This library provides extra commands for [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LookMode][look-mode]] (see below).
;; In addition if you mark some files in a dired buffer and then run look-at-file (or press M-l), 
;; all of the marked files will be visited in the *look* buffer.
;; ** New commands
;; - look-dired-do-rename                  : Rename current looked file, to location given by TARGET.
;; - look-dired-unmark-looked-files        : Unmark all the files in `look-buffer' in the corresponding dired-mode buffer.
;; - look-dired-mark-looked-files          : Mark all the files in `look-buffer' in the corresponding dired-mode buffer.
;; - look-dired-mark-current-looked-file   : Mark `look-current-file' in the corresponding dired-mode buffer.
;; - look-dired-unmark-current-looked-file : Unmark `look-current-file' in the corresponding dired-mode buffer.
;; - look-dired-run-associated-program     : Run program associated with currently looked at file.

;;    Keybinding: M-x look-dired-find
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below is a list of customizable options:
;;


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put look-dired.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

the LOOK-WILDCARD argument, or a dired buffer containing marked files as the 
DIRED-BUFFER argument, or a list of files as the FILE-LIST argument.

Prompts user for target, which is a directory in which to create the new files. 
Target may also be a plain file if only one marked file exists.  
The way the default for the target directory is computed depends on the value

ARG as in `dired-get-marked-files'.
Optional arg MARKER-CHAR as in `dired-create-files'.e
Optional arg OP1 is an alternate form for OPERATION if there is only one file.
Optional arg PROMPT determines whether prompts for the target location.
`nil' means not prompt and TARGET-FILE is the target location, non-nil
means prompt for the target location.
Optional arg HOW-TO determiness how to treat the target.
If HOW-TO is nil, use `file-directory-p' to determine if the
target is a directory.  If so, the marked file(s) are created
inside that directory.  Otherwise, the target is a plain file;
an error is raised unless there is exactly one marked file.
If HOW-TO is t, target is always treated as a plain file.
Otherwise, HOW-TO should be a function of one argument, TARGET.
If its return value is nil, TARGET is regarded as a plain file.
If it return value is a list, TARGET is a generalized
directory (e.g. some sort of archive).  The first element of
this list must be a function with at least four arguments:
 operation - as OPERATION above.
 rfn-list  - list of the relative names for the marked files.
 fn-list   - list of the absolute names for the marked files.
 target    - the name of the target itself.
