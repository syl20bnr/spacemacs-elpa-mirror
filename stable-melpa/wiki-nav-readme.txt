[[<Quickstart]]

    (require 'wiki-nav)

    (global-wiki-nav-mode 1)

    Sprinkle double-bracketed [[links]] in your code comments

[[<Explanation]]

Wiki-nav.el is a minor mode which recognizes [[wiki-style]]
double-bracketed navigation links in any type of file, providing
the ability to jump between sections, between files, or open
external links.

Wiki-nav.el requires button-lock.el, which in turn requires
font-lock.el.  Font-lock.el is provided with Emacs.
Button-lock.el is available here

    http://github.com/rolandwalker/button-lock

[[<Example usage]]

    Add the following to your ~/.emacs

        (require 'wiki-nav)
        (global-wiki-nav-mode 1)

    and sprinkle

        [[links]]

    throughout your files.  That's it.  There's more functionality,
    but simple [[links]] may be all you need.

    Clicking a [[link]] will invoke a text search for the next
    matching link.  Double-clicking a link will search for matching
    links in all open buffers.

    Text-matching between links is always case-insensitive.

    To navigate upward to a previous matching link, add a '<'
    symbol before the search text

        [[<links]]

    You can insert the '>' symbol, too, but that simply indicates
    the default forward-search navigation.

    Both forward and backward navigation will wrap around the ends
    of the file without prompting.

    Leading and trailing space inside a link is ignored.

    From the keyboard:

        control-c control-w

                      skip forward in the buffer to the next link

        control-c control-W

                      skip backward in the buffer to the previous link

        return        if positioned on a link, activate it

        tab           if positioned on a link, skip forward in the
                      buffer to the next link of any kind (need not
                      match the current link)

        S-tab         if positioned on a link, skip backward in the
                      buffer to the previous link of any kind (need not
                      not match the current link)

Advanced usage:

    Bracketed links may contain external URLs

        [[http://google.com]]

    Or they may use various internally-recognized URI schemes:

    visit: navigates to another file

        [[visit:/etc/hosts]]

        [[visit:/path/to/another/file:NameOfLink]]

    func: navigates to the definition of a function

        [[func:main]]

    line: navigates to a line number

        [[line:12]]

    visit: may be combined with other schemes:

        [[visit:/path/to/another/file:func:main]]

        [[visit:/etc/hosts:line:5]]

    Path names and similar strings are subjected to URI-style
    unescaping before lookup.  To link a filename which contains a
    colon, substitute "%3A" for the colon character.

    See the documentation for the function wiki-nav for more
    information.

[[<Notes]]

    wiki-nav uses industry-standard left-clicks rather than
    Emacs-traditional middle clicks.

    It is difficult to edit the text inside a link using the
    mouse.  To make a link inactive, position the point after the
    link and backspace into it.  Once the trailing delimiters have
    been modified, the link reverts to ordinary text.

[[<Bugs]]

    Only highlights first match on each comment line.

    Double-square-brackets represent a valid construct in some
    programming languages (especially shell), and may be mistakenly
    linked.  Workaround: don't click.  Second workaround: add mode to
    wiki-nav-comment-only-modes via customize.  Third workaround:
    change delimiters triple-square-brackets via customize.

    Newlines are not escaped in regexp fields in customize.

    Case-sensitivity on matching the delimiters is unknown because
    it depends on how font-lock-defaults was called for the current
    mode.  However, this is not an issue unless the default delimiters
    are changed to use alphabetical characters.

    Auto-complete interacts and causes keyboard interaction
    problems.  Auto-complete should be suppressed if the point is
    on a link?

    Difficult to reproduce: keystrokes sometimes leaking through to
    the editor during keyboard navigation.  Tends to happen on first
    navigation, when key is pressed quickly?

    The global minor mode causes button-lock to be turned off/back
    on for every buffer.

    GNU Emacs version 24.4           : yes

    GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
    GNU Emacs version 22.2           : yes, with some limitations
    GNU Emacs version 21.x and lower : unknown

    Requires button-lock.el

    Uses if present: nav-flash.el, back-button.el

[[<Todo]]

    ido support - document and provide default bindings

    instead of comment-only modes, check if comment syntax is present
    in buffer as is done in fixmee-mode, and use syntax-ppss rather
    than regexp to detect comment context

    support kbd-help property

    follow the doc for defgroup to find link functions which are
    built-in to Emacs

    these and other widgets are used in customize/help
    wiki-nav should reuse the widget functions (wid-edit.el and others)
        emacs-commentary-link
        emacs-library-link
    and the xref functions in help-mode.el

    use a function matcher in font-lock keywords instead of regexp to
    get comment-only matches to work perfectly.  fixmee.el has correct
    code to match in comment

    wiki-nav-external-link-pattern might be replaced with functions
    from url-util

    visit:-1 counts from end of file

    keyboard analog for double-click

    right-click context menu

    link any string <<<text>>> together within a file
    like org-mode radio links

    patch font-lock to support keyword searching in comment only,
    like 'keep, only different - maybe not needed if using a func
    instead of a regexp in keyword

    raised button style option

    break down monolithic dispatch function wiki-nav-action-1

    schemes to add
        search:
        regexp:
        elisp:

    wiki-nav-links can be optimized by tracking which buffers are
    completely fontified - doesn't font-lock do that?

    similarly, speed up wiki-nav-find-any-link by remembering if
    the buffer is fontified, or switch to searching by regexp

    version of wiki-nav-find-any-link that does not wrap

    wiki-nav-ido can only go to one occurrence of a duplicate -
    may not always be first

    toggle key for switching to all buffers within wiki-nav-ido
    prompt

    sort recently-used items first in wiki-nav-ido - see
    yas/insert-snippet for example
