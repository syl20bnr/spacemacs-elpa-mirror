;; A major mode for Pixie-lang.

;;; Code:

(require 'clojure-mode)
(require 'inf-clojure)

(unless (fboundp 'setq-local)
  (defmacro setq-local (var val)
    `(set (make-local-variable ',var) ,val)))

(defcustom pixie-inf-lisp-program "pixie-vm"
  "The program used to start an inferior pixie in Inferior Clojure mode."
  :type 'string
  :group 'pixie
  :safe 'stringp)

(defcustom pixie-inf-lisp-load-command "(load-file \"%s\")"
  "The format string for building an expression that loads a pixie file."
  :type 'string
  :group 'pixie
  :safe 'stringp)

;; I'm not of aware of a way to share variables over small groups of
;; buffers, especially ones that aren't in pixie-mode. Is there a
;; better approach than defadvice with a let?
