;;; Commentary:

;; Related global minor mode helps you to navigate across similarly
;; named buffers.
;;
;; You might want to add the following code to your .emacs :
;;
;;  (require 'related)
;;  (related-mode)
;;
;; Then use "C-x <up>" to switch to next related buffer, and "C-x
;; <down>" to come back.  If you are not happy with those key
;; bindings, you might want to try something like this :
;;
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "<your key seq>") 'related-switch-forward)
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "<your key seq>") 'related-switch-backward)
;;
;; You might also want to try related-switch-buffer, which prompts you
;; for the next related buffer to go to, and integrates nicely with
;; helm or ido (no default key binding here).
;;
;; Related derives from each buffer a hopefully meaningful "base name"
;; and buffers with same "base name" form a group.  Related helps you
;; to navigate those groups.
;;
;; For example, buffers visiting the following files :
;;
;;  /path/to/include/foo.h
;;  /path/to/source/foo.c
;;  /path/to/doc/foo.org
;;
;; Would be grouped together (their names reduce to "foo"). Supposing
;; you have dozens of opened buffers, and are working in "foo.h",
;; Related helps you to cycle across "foo" buffers :
;;
;; Cycle "forward" with "C-x <up>" :
;;
;;  foo.h -> foo.c -> foo.org
;;     ^                 |
;;     +-----------------+
;;
;; And cycle "backward" with ""C-x <down>" :
;;
;;  foo.h <- foo.c <- foo.org
;;     |                 ^
;;     +-----------------+
;;
;; When deriving a "base name" from a buffer path, the following rules
;; are applied :
;;
;;  - Remove directories
;;  - Remove extensions
;;  - Remove non-alpha characters
;;  - Convert remaining characters to lower case
;;
;; Thus "/another/path/to/FOO-123.bar.baz" would also reduce to "foo".
