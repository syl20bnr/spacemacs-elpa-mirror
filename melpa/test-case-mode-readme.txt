`test-case-mode' is a minor mode for running unit tests.  It is extensible
and currently comes with back-ends for JUnit, CxxTest, CppUnit, gtest, Python
and Ruby.

The back-ends probably need some more path options to work correctly.
Please let me know, as I'm not an expert on all of them.

To install test-case-mode, add the following to your .emacs:
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/test-case-mode")
(autoload 'test-case-mode "test-case-mode" nil t)
(autoload 'enable-test-case-mode-if-test "test-case-mode")
(autoload 'test-case-find-all-tests "test-case-mode" nil t)
(autoload 'test-case-compilation-finish-run-all "test-case-mode")

To enable it automatically when opening test files:
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'enable-test-case-mode-if-test)

If you want to run all visited tests after a compilation, add:
(add-hook 'compilation-finish-functions
          'test-case-compilation-finish-run-all)

If failures have occurred, they are highlighted in the buffer and/or its
fringes (if fringe-helper.el is installed).

fringe-helper is available at:
http://nschum.de/src/emacs/fringe-helper/

Limitations:
C++ tests can be compiled in a multitude of ways.  test-case-mode currently
only supports running them if each test class comes in its own file.
