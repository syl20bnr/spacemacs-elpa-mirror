;;; Commentary:
;; 
;;    When spell correcting, this package forces you to fix your mistakes
;;    three times to re-write your muscle memory into typing it correctly.
;; 
;; * Motivation
;; 
;;    I used to type 'necessary' wrong... ALL THE TIME.  I misspelled it so
;;    often that it became part of my muscle memory.  It is one of *THOSE*
;;    words for me.  There are others, that by muscle or brain memory,
;;    are "burned in" as a particular pattern.
;; 
;;    This is an attempt to break that pattern, by forcing you to re-type
;;    your misspelled words 3 times.  This should help overcome any broken
;;    muscle and brain memory.
;; 
;; * Usage
;; 
;; ** Fixing Spelling Mistakes 
;;    - Step 1 :: Require this file
;;    - Step 2 :: Use M-$ to check the spelling of your misspelled word
;;    - Step 3 :: follow the directions of the prompt
;; 
;; ** Fixing Spelling Mistakes Automagickally
;; 
;;    If you want, you can customize the
;;    `fix-muscle-memory-load-problem-words' variable, and that will
;;    force you to fix the typos when you make them, rather than at
;;    spell-check time.  Alternatively just call
;;    `fix-muscle-memory-load-problem-words' with nil and an alist of
;;    problem words in the format of (("tyop" . "typo")).
;; 
;;    Because this uses abbrev mode, you will need to make sure to enable
;;    it.
;; 
;; ** Helping with Extended commands
;; 
;;   If you find yourself using `execute-extended-command' in place of a
;;   keybinding, using this will help train you.  The first three
;;   instances of the same extended command will go through normally.
;;   The next time however you will be told the key-combo to use and then
;;   prompted to enter it three times.
;; 
;;   Customize `fix-muscle-memory-enable-extended-command' and you're off
;;   to the races.
;; 
;; ** Getting out
;;   
;;   Entering in the wrong answer more than 6 times or so will exit out
;;   of the loop.  Alternatively C-g (quit) will get you out as well.
;; 
;; ** Super Kawaii
;; 
;;   Customize the variable `fix-muscle-memory-use-emoji' to true to use
;;   cute emoji icons along with text. 
;; 
;; ** Easy Setup with use-package
;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (use-package 'fix-muscle-memory
;;   :init
;;   (setq fix-muscle-memory-use-emoji t)
;;   :config
;;   (fix-muscle-memory-load-problem-words 'foo
;;                                         '(("teh" . "the")
;;                                           ("comptuer" . "computer")
;;                                           ("destory" . "destroy")
;;                                           ("occured" . "occurred")))
