;;; Change Log:

;; 1.4:
;; * Use `alert' package by default if available (`gnus-desktop-notify-alert').
;;
;; 1.3:
;; * Use `notifications' in emacs 24 (if available) by default (new function
;;   `gnus-desktop-notify-dbus').
;; * Renamed `gnus-desktop-notify-send' to `gnus-desktop-notify-behavior'.
;; * `gnus-desktop-notify-behavior' is now consistent across all notification
;;   functions (exec/send/dbus).
;;
;; 1.2:
;; * Collapse group names by default (see
;;   `gnus-desktop-notify-uncollapsed-levels').

;;; Commentary:

;; Desktop notification integration in Gnus!? Ohh goody!
;;
;; ``gnus-desktop-notify.el`` provides a simple mechanism to notify the user
;; when new messages are received. For basic usage, to be used in conjunction
;; with `gnus-daemon', put the following:
;;
;; (require 'gnus-desktop-notify)
;; (gnus-desktop-notify-mode)
;; (gnus-demon-add-scanmail)
;;
;; into your ``.gnus`` file. The default is to use `alert' if available, which
;; works on every operating system and allows the user to customize the
;; notification through Emacs. See https://github.com/jwiegley/alert#for-users
;; for further info. If not available, the `notifications' library (part of
;; Emacs >= 24) is used, so no external dependencies are required. With Emacs
;; <= 23 instead the generic ``notify-send`` program is used, which (in Debian
;; or Ubuntu) is available in the ``libnotify-bin`` package.
;;
;; You can also call any program directly by changing the
;; `gnus-desktop-notify-exec-program' variable, or change the behavior entirely
;; by setting a different `gnus-desktop-notify-function' function.
;;
;; By default, all groups are notified when new messages are received. You can
;; exclude a single group by setting the `group-notify' group parameter to `t'.
;; You can also selectively monitor groups instead by changing the
;; `gnus-desktop-notify-groups' variable to `gnus-desktop-notify-explicit' and
;; then manually selecting which groups to include. Press 'G c' in the group
;; buffer to customize group parameters interactively.
;;
;; The behavior of the notification can be tuned by changing the
;; `gnus-desktop-notify-behavior' variable.
;;
;; See the `gnus-desktop-notify' customization group for more details.
;;
;; Feel free to send suggestions and patches to wavexx AT thregr.org
