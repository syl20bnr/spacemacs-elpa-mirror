;; Package tested on:
;; GNU Emacs 25.2.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin16.5.0)

;; A simple implementation of the yahtzee game.

;; Quick start:
;;
;; add (require 'yahtzee) in your .emacs
;; M-x yahtzee  start a game (in a new buffer)
;; C-c n        start a new game (in the same buffer)
;; C-c p        add players
;; C-c P        reset players
;; SPC          throw dice
;; {1,2,3,4,5}  hold outcome of {1,2,3,4,5}-th dice
;; UP/DOWN      select score to register
;; ENTER        register selected score
;; w            save the game (in json format)
;;
;; The score of a saved game can be loaded using `M-x yahtzee-load-game-score`.
;;
;; Configuration variables:
;;
;; The user might want to set the following variables
;; (see associated docstrings)
;;   - `yahtzee-output-file-base'
;;   - `yahtzee-fields-alist'      for adding extra fields
;;   - `yahtzee-players-names'     set names of players
;;                                 use (setq-default yahtzee-players-names ...)
;;
;; Note:
;;    personally I don't enjoy playing with "Yahtzee bonuses" and "Joker rules"
;;    so they are not implemented (even thought they are simple to include).
;;    Only the "63 bonus" is available (see `yahtzee-compute-bonus').
;;    Furthermore, some scores differ from the official ones.  Changing all
;;    this can be done by simply modifying the corresponding functions in the
;;    definition of `yahtzee-fields-alist'.
