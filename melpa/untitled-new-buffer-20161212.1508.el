;;; Commentary:

;; In some text editors, the new buffer has no association with the file.
;; This package emulates *unsaved* new buffers.
;;
;; ## Key binding
;;
;; Put the following into your .emacs file (~/.emacs.d/init.el)
;;
;;     (bind-key "M-N" 'untitled-new-buffer-with-select-major-mode)
;;
;; ## Customize
;;
;; You can customize this package by `M-x customize-group untitle-new-buffer'.
;; Or put the following into your .emacs file.
;;
;;     ;; Only modes your know.
;;     (setq untitled-new-buffer-major-modes '(php-mode enh-ruby-mode python-mode sql-mode text-mode prog-mode markdown-mode))
;;     ;; Change default buffer name.
;;     (setq untitled-new-buffer-default-name "New File")
