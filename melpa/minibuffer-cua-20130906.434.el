;;; Commentary:

;;; This module makes CUA mode's S-up/S-down selection movement work
;;; in minibuffer.
;;;
;;; Necessary key bindings are set up for minibuffer by calling
;;; minibuffer-cua-setup.
;;;
;;; (require 'minibuffer-cua)
;;; (minibuffer-cua-setup)

;;; Code:

(defun minibuffer-cua-forward-line (&optional n)
  "Call `forward-line' with argument N, preventing the cursor from moving into the prompt string."
  (forward-line n)
  (when (= (point-min) (point))
    (end-of-line)
    (beginning-of-line)))

(defun minibuffer-cua-shift-next-line (&optional n)
  "Emulate [S-down] selection of CUA mode, moving N lines forward."
  (interactive "p")
  (or mark-active
      (push-mark (point) t t))
  (minibuffer-cua-forward-line n))

(defun minibuffer-cua-shift-previous-line (&optional n)
  "Emulate [S-up] selection of CUA mode, moving N lines backward."
  (interactive "p")
  (or mark-active
      (push-mark (point) t t))
  (minibuffer-cua-forward-line (- n)))

;;;###autoload
(defun minibuffer-cua-define-keys ()
  "Define key bindings in `minibuffer-local-map'."
  (local-set-key (kbd "S-<down>") 'minibuffer-cua-shift-next-line)
  (local-set-key (kbd "S-<up>") 'minibuffer-cua-shift-previous-line))

;;;###autoload
(defun minibuffer-cua-setup ()
  "Enable S-up and S-down in minibuffer."
  (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook 'minibuffer-cua-define-keys))

(provide 'minibuffer-cua)
