;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Interactive command (`info-buffer') to display each info topic on its
;; separate buffer.  With prefix, display an already opened topic on a new
;; buffer.

;; If you're using `use-package', you can easily re-define Emacs's info binding
;; to use `info-buffer' instead:

;;   (use-package info-buffer
;;     :bind (("C-h i" . info-buffer)))

;;; Code:

(require 'info)


(defun info-buffer--open (topic bufname)
  "Open info on TOPIC in BUFNAME."
  (if (get-buffer bufname)
      (switch-to-buffer bufname)
    (info topic bufname)))

;;;###autoload
(defun info-buffer (topic replicate)
  "Display Info TOPIC in its own buffer.

Displays TOPIC on the current window, and reuses an existing
buffer if it is already showing TOPIC.

With prefix, or if REPLICATE is non-nil, never reuse an existing
buffer."
  (interactive
   (list
    (progn
      (info-initialize)
      (completing-read "Display manual: "
		       (info--manual-names nil)
		       nil t))
    current-prefix-arg))
  (let ((bufname (format "*info: %s*" topic)))
    (when replicate
      (setq bufname (generate-new-buffer-name bufname)))
    (info-buffer--open topic bufname)))

(provide 'info-buffer)
