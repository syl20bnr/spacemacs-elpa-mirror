This is a typing game for Emacs.  In this game, you type words that are
picked randomly from N most frequent words in language you're practicing,
until time is up (by default it's one minute).  Typit is quite similar to
the “10 fast fingers” tests, with the difference that it's playable and
fully configurable inside your Emacs.
