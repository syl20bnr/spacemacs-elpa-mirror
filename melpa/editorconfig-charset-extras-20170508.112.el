;;; Commentary:

;; This library adds extra charset supports to editorconfig-emacs.
;; The list of supported charsets is taken from the result of
;; `coding-system-list'.

;; For example, add following to your `.editorconfig`
;; and `sjis.txt` will be opend with `sjis' encoding:

;;     [sjis.txt]
;;     charset = sjis

;; Alternatively, you can specify `emacs_charset` as:

;;     [sjis.txt]
;;     emacs_charset = sjis

;; If both `charset' and `emacs_charset' are defined, the value of
;; `emacs_charset' takes precedence.

;;; Code:

(defun editorconfig-charset-extras--decide (charset emacs-charset)
  "Decide whcih charset to use from CHARSET and EMACS-CHARSET.

CHARSET and EMACS-CHARSET are directly passwd from .editorconfig hash object.
If no apropriate charset found return nil."
  (let ((coding-systems (coding-system-list))
        (charset-interned (and charset
                               (not (string= "" charset))
                               (intern charset)))
        (emacs-charset-interned (and emacs-charset
                                     (not (string= "" emacs-charset))
                                     (intern emacs-charset))))
    (if (and emacs-charset-interned
             (memq emacs-charset-interned
                   coding-systems))
        emacs-charset-interned
      (message "editorconfig-charset-extras: Charset not found: %S"
               emacs-charset-interned)
      (if (and charset-interned
               (memq charset-interned
                     coding-systems))
          charset-interned
        (message "editorconfig-charset-extras: Charset not found: %S"
                 charset-interned)
        nil))))
