;;; Commentary:
;;
;; numbers.el is a little wrapper around http://numbersapi.com/ that can be
;; used to display maths information and trivia about numbers.
;;
;; Two main commands are provided:
;;
;; `numbers-math' - Shows/inserts a maths-related fact about a number.
;;
;; `number-trivia' - Shows/inserts some trivia about a number.
;;
;; In both cases calling the command will prompt for a number. If there
;; appears to be a number in the current buffer, near the current point,
;; that number will be used as the default.
;;
;; If `universal-argument' is invoked first the result will be inserted into
;; the current buffer, otherwise it is displayed in the message area. On the
;; other hand, if number is provided as the prefix argument it is looked up
;; and the result is displayed.
;;
;; In addition, a couple of commands are provided for getting facts and
;; trivia about a random number:
;;
;; `numbers-random-math' - Shows/inserts a maths-related fact about a random
;; number.
;;
;; `numbers-random-trivia' - Shows/inserts some trivia about a random
;; number.
