;;; Commentary:

;; `pmdm.el' is a simple alternative to desktop-mode for storing
;; and opening loaded files.
;;
;; Run `pmdm-write-opened-files' manually (or in a hook) before quitting
;; emacs to save the files you want to restore later and `pmdm-load-files'
;; to open the stored files again.
;;
;; Customizable variable `pmdm-file-name' contains the name of the file
;; used to store the files list.

;;; Updates:

;; 2015/08/07 Initial version.
;; 2015/08/17 Adopted emacs-lisp code conventions.
