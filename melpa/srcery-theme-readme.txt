Port of vim-srcery: https://github.com/roosta/vim-srcery , a dark color theme
with with focus on clearly defined contrastig colors and relative ease of
use. Srcery should play well with a 256 color terminal, provided the terminal
colors are set to srcery colors. See here for sample terminal configs:
