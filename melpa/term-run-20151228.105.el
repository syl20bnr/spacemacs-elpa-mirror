;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides two functions to invoke programs with arguments
;; in a buffer which works as a terminal-emulator.


;; term-run-shell-command (command $optional new-buffer-p)

;; Run COMMAND in a terminal buffer.

;; This function is intended mainly to be called interactively and
;; asks the command-line to invoke.

;; If called with prefix argument, this function will generate new
;; terminal buffer for running COMMAND.  Otherwise, always use the buffer named
;; *Term-Run Shell Command*. In this case, the old process in the buffer will be
;; destroyed.


;; term-run (program &optional buffer-or-name &rest args)

;; Run PROGRAM in BUFFER-OR-NAME with ARGS in terminal buffer.

;; If BUFFER-OR-NAME is given, use this buffer.  In this case, old process in
;; the buffer will be destroyed.  Otherwise, new buffer will be generated
;; automatically from PROGRAM.

;; This function returns the buffer where the process starts running.
