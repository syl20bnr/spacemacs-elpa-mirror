;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs is your astrologer, read its interpretation with:
;;   M-x horoscope
;; No need to tell it your birth date, Emacs already knows you well enough.

;; Bob Manson originally wrote this program in ksh,
;; then later converted it to Emacs Lisp.
;; Noah Friedman rewrote parts of the engine.
