;; This library provides extra commands for filtering and applying process marks to
;; articles in the gnus summary buffer, some commands for performing actions on MIME
;; parts in articles, and some general functions for evaluating elisp code in marked articles.

;; You can apply complex filters for filtering the messages displayed in the *Summary* buffer
;; using `gnus-summary-ext-limit-filter', or apply the process mark to such articles with
;; `gnus-summary-ext-uu-mark-filter'.
;; You can save these filters in `gnus-summary-ext-saved-filters'.
;; 
;; To add new keybindings for these new filter commands add `gnus-summary-ext-hook' to `gnus-summary-mode-hook'.

;; See the documentation of the individual commands & functions for more
;; details.

(defun gnus-summary-ext-filter (expr)
  "Return list of article numbers of articles in summary buffer which match EXPR.
EXPR can be any elisp form to be eval'ed for each article which returns non-nil for required articles.
It can utilize named filters stored in `gnus-summary-ext-saved-filters' (which should be surrounded
in parentheses, e.g: (filter)), and any of the following functions:

 (subject REGEXP) : matches articles with subject field matching REGEXP
 (from REGEXP) : matches articles with from field matching REGEXP 
 (to REGEXP) : matches articles with To: field matching REGEXP
 (cc REGEXP) : matches articles with Cc: field matching REGEXP
 (recipient REGEXP) : matches articles with To: or Cc: field matching REGEXP
 (address REGEXP) : matches articles with To:, Cc: or From: field matching REGEXP
 (read) : matches articles that have been read
 (unread) : matches articles that haven't yet been read (equivalent to (not (read)))
 (replied) : matches articles which have been replied to 
 (unreplied) : matches articles which haven't been replied to (equivalent to (not (replied)))
 (age DAYS) : matches articles received before/after DAYS days ago (see `gnus-summary-limit-to-age')
 (agebetween MIN MAX) : matches articles received between MIN and MAX days ago.
 (marks STR) : matches articles with any of the marks in STR (see `gnus-summary-limit-to-marks')

The following functions can also be used but will be much slower since they are evaluated after selecting
each article:

 (witharticle PRED)     : matches articles for which PRED returns non-nil after selecting article buffer
 (withorigarticle PRED) : matches articles for which PRED returns non-nil after selecting original (unformatted) article buffer
 (content REGEXP)  : matches articles containing text that matches REGEXP 
 (header HDRX REGEXP) : matches articles containing a header matching HDRX whose value matches REGEXP
 (filename REGEXP) : matches articles containing file attachments whose names match REGEXP
 (mimetype REGEXP) : matches articles containing mime parts with type names matching REGEXP
 (numparts MIN MAX) : matches articles with between MIN and MAX parts/attachments (inclusive).
                      Note: html and embedded images count as parts, and often there are several of these in an article.
 (size MIN MAX) : matches articles of approximate size between MIN & MAX bytes. 
                  If MAX is omitted then just check if size is bigger than MIN bytes

For example, to filter messages received within the last week, either from alice or sent to bob:
  (gnus-summary-ext-filter '(and (age -7) (or (from \"alice\") (to \"bob\"))))

To filter unreplied messages that are matched by either of the saved filters 'work' or 'friends':
  (gnus-summary-ext-filter '(and (unreplied) (or (work) (friends))))"
