;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minor mode that will do two things
;; after a successful recompile:
;; 1) bury the *compilation* buffer, and
;; 2) restore your window configuration to how it looked when you
;; issued the last recompile, ignoring successive compilations to
;; squash bugs.

;; Usage:

;; (bury-successful-compilation 1)

;;; Code:

(defgroup bury-successful-compilation nil
  "Bury successful *compilation* buffers."
  :group 'compilation :group 'programming)

(defcustom bury-successful-compilation-precompile-window-state nil

window configuration after a successful compilation."
