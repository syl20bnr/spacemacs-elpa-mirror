(defun hookify-is-hook-p (symbol)
  "Returns t if SYMBOL is a hook."
  (and (boundp symbol)
       (s-ends-with? "-hook" (symbol-name symbol))))

  "Append or remove a lambda containing FORM to HOOK.

If GLOBAL is true, make a global hook, otherwise a local one.
If REMOVE is true, removes the form from the hook, otherwise append it."
