;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode that can make all comments temporarily invisible.
;;
;; In most situations, comments in a program are good.  However,
;; exuberant use of comments may make it harder to follow the flow of
;; the actual program.  By temporarily making comments invisible, the
;; program will stand out more clearly.
;;
;; "Invisible" in this context means that the comments will not be
;; visible but they will still take up the same space they did before,
;; so non-comment portions will not move.

;; Example:
;;
;; | Before                     | After                         |
;; | ------                     | -----                         |
;; | ![](doc/before.png)        | ![](doc/after.png)            |


;; Install:
;;
;; Install this using the build-in Emacs package manager, e.g. using
;; `M-x package-install-from-file RET nocomments-mode.el RET'.

;; Usage:
;;
;; This package provides two minor modes:
;;
;; - `nocomments-mode' - Local minor mode that makes all comments in
;;   current buffer invisible.
;;
;; - `nocomments-global-mode' - Global minor mode that makes all
;;   comments in all buffers invisible.

;; Configuration:
;;
;; For convenience, you can bind a key to toggle the visibility of
;; comment.  For example, you can place the following in a suitable
;; init file to make F12 toggle comments:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") #'nocomments-mode)

;;; Code:

;; Implementation:
;;
;; A naive approach, to reassign `font-lock-comment-face', doesn't
;; work when packages highlight things inside comment (like
;; `emacs-lisp-mode' mode does with quoted words). Instead, a
;; font-lock keyword is used to search for comment, the rule sets the
;; `display' property to display a space instead of the character and
;; removes the `face' property.
