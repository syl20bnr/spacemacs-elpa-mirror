This code is an extension of the `persp-mode' mode that uses your GUI window
title (aka Emacs frame name) to show the list of current perspectives and
indicates the current one. It also permits to move the current perspective to
the left, right, first or last position.

Installation:

From the MELPA: M-x package-install RET `persp-fr' RET.

From a file: M-x `package-install-file' RET 'path to this file' RET Or put
this file into your load-path.

Usage:

The same as `persp-mode':

   (require 'persp-fr)    ;; was (require 'persp-mode)
   (persp-fr-start)

Customization:

The customization group lets you tweak few parameters: M-x `customize-group'
RET 'persp-fr' RET.

Useful keys to change to next/previous perspective, as in most user
interfaces using tabs, and to move current perspective to left/right:

    (global-set-key [(control prior)] 'persp-prev)
    (global-set-key [(control next)] 'persp-next)
    (global-set-key [(control meta next)] 'persp-fr-move-right)
    (global-set-key [(control meta prior)] 'persp-fr-move-left)


Tested only under Linux / Gnome. Feedback welcome!
