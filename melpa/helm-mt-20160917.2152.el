;;; Commentary:

;; Helm bindings for managing `multi-term' terminals as well as
;; shells.  A call to `helm-mt` will show a list of terminal sessions
;; managed by `multi-term` as well as buffers with major mode
;; `shell-mode`.  From there, you are able to create, delete or switch
;; over to existing terminal buffers.
