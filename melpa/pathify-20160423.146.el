;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides some code for convenient symlinking files into
;; particular directory (`pathify-directory').  It is intended to be
;; used for symlinking your scripts (or other executable files) into
;; your "~/bin" directory (as you surely have it in your PATH
;; environment variable :-).

;; To install the package manually, add the following to your init file:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/pathify-dir")
;;   (autoload 'pathify "pathify" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'pathify-dired "pathify" nil t)
;;
;; Optionally, set `pathify-directory' variable (if you do not use
;; "~/bin"):

;; Now you may use "M-x pathify-dired" command in a dired buffer to
;; pathify the marked files (or the current file if nothing is marked).
;; For more convenience, you may bind this command to some key, for
;; example:
;;
;;   (eval-after-load 'dired
;;     '(define-key dired-mode-map "P" 'pathify-dired))
