Google+ does not have any markup for program code, which is highly
annoying. This simple command will add some markup to share code
more easily on Google+, based on fontification.

Sadly, it will break if the code itself includes Google+ markup. As
there is no escape mechanism included in Google+, there's not much
we can do there.
