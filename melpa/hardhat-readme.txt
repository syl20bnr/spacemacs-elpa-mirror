Quickstart

    (require 'hardhat)

    (global-hardhat-mode 1)

    ;; now you are protected from editing:
    ;;
    ;;     .git/index
    ;;     ~/.emacs.d/elpa/hardhat-0.1.0/hardhat.el
    ;;     ~/.emacs~
    ;;
    ;; and many others

Explanation

A recent unwholesome trend is for package managers to install files
in locations such as ~/.cabal/, ~/.rvm/, or ~/.emacs.d/elpa/.  It
is rarely meant for such files to be edited; doing so can cause
data loss in some circumstances.

In addition, many user-writable files created in the course of
ordinary work should never be altered by a text editor, eg the
database stored in a .git directory.

Hardhat.el provides an extra layer of protection in your work.  If
you visit a file which looks unsafe to edit, Emacs will make the
buffer read-only -- even when the underlying file is writable.

The read-only protection can be turned off for a buffer by the
usual methods, or by toggling off buffer-local hardhat-mode via
the lighter menu or

    M-x hardhat-mode RET

If a buffer is not visiting a file, `hardhat-mode' has no effect.
If the visited file is not writable by the user, `hardhat-mode'
has no effect.

To use hardhat, place the hardhat.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'hardhat)
    (global-hardhat-mode 1)

To inquire as to why hardhat has set or unset protection in
a buffer, the following interactive command is provided

    `hardhat-status'

but not bound to any key.

    M-x customize-group RET hardhat RET

Notes

    `hardhat-mode' takes no action until the user attempts an
    interactive command in a buffer.  This is (out of an abundance
    of caution) for compatibility: an Emacs Lisp library may freely
    open and write to a file protected by `hardhat-mode', so long as
    it is done programatically.

    For any of the options settable in customize, rules making
    buffers "editable" override rules making buffers "protected".

    A Boolean file-local variable `hardhat-protect' is provided.
    When `hardhat-protect' is set to either t or nil, no other
    rules are consulted.

    Regular-expression matches are case-insensitive.  A case-
    sensitive test can be implemented by adding custom function
    to eg `hardhat-buffer-protected-functions'.

Bugs

    More exceptions are certainly needed in `hardhat-fullpath-editable-regexps'

    Because Emacs can wedge if `file-truename' is called on a
    remote file (eg when using TRAMP), some filename tests used in
    hardhat are not precisely equivalent between local and remote
    files.  You can change this behavior by setting
    `hardhat-use-unsafe-remote-truename' via customize.  A better
    solution is to set `find-file-visit-truename' globally.
