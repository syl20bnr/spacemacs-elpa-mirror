Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to
efficient GPU code.  This Emacs mode provides syntax highlighting and
conservative automatic indentation for Futhark source code.

Files with the ".fut" extension are automatically handled by this mode.

For extensions: Define local keybindings in `futhark-mode-map'.  Add startup
functions to `futhark-mode-hook'.
