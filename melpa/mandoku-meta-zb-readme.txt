This package provides the zb repository metadata for the mandoku
package (See http://www.mandoku.org for more information about
mandoku). Additional metadata packages can added in the same way,
following some simple conventions:

- The package should be named starting with "mandoku-meta-"

- The package should define autoloads that provide an entry point
  for the directory of the catalog metadata and the repository URL,
  as below.

- The catalog format and the repository API should follow the
  mandoku conventions.
