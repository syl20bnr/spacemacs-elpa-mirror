This package adds Czech (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic)
public holidays to the Emacs calendar.

If you have `org-agenda-include-diary` set to `t`, these will be
also listed in the `org-agenda` view.

Installation

This package is available on MELPA, just `M-x` `package-install`
`czech-holidays`. If you want to install it manually, clone this
repository somewhere, add it to `load-path`, and add
`(require 'czech-holidays)` to `.emacs`.

Configuration

Add a call to `(czech-holidays-add)` somewhere in your `.emacs`.
Note that this must be called *before* Emacs calendar is loaded.
